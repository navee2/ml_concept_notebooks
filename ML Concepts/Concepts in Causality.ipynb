    "* **Potential outcomes**: Y\n",
    "* **ATE**: Average treatment effect. $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$\n",
    "* **Ignorability**: We can ignore the unknown.\n",
    "$$(Y(1), Y(0))$$ is independent of T\n",
    "This implies causal treatment effect equals statistical difference in population.\n",
    "$$E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)] = E[Y|T=1] = E[Y|T=0]$$\n",
    "* **Exchangeability**: We can exchange the Test and Control without any effect on Expectations\n",
    "$$E[Y(1)|T=1]=E[Y(1)|T=0]=E[Y(1)]$$\n",
    "Exchangeability implies ignorability\n",
    "* **Identifiablity**: A causal measure is identifiable if it can be calculated using statistical equations. RCT creates identifiability by introducing ignorability. \n",
    "* **Conditional exchangeabilty/Unconfoundedness**: Given factor X, outcome is indepnendent of Treatment/control group. Its impossible to guarantee unconfoundedness because of some latent compounding factor.\n",
    "$$ATE = E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)] = E_{X}(E[Y|T=1, X] - E[Y|T=0, X])$$\n",
    "* **No interference**: $Y_{i}(t_1, t_2....t_n) = Y_i(t_j)$ That is no other factor matters\n",
    "* **consistency**: T=t=> Y=Y(t) - same treatment cause same outcome. That is there is no multiple outcome version of treament.\n",
    "* **Positivity**: For any X there exists both treatments $0<P(T=1|X=x)<1$\n",
    "* **Overlap**: Domains of treatments overlap. Otherwise there might be extrapolation which might lead to diffult to model results.\n",
